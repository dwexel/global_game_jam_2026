CHRISTY,

ATTACHED IS THE PAPERWORK FOR FIRING DR. LEENA BRIGGS FROM NEUROTECH ON THE CONSULTING TEAM. I AM SURE YOU HAVE HEARD THE CHATTER ABOUT MRS. LEENA, BUT I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND I TAKE THESE MATTERS VERY SERIOUSLY. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THAT HER NDA IS UP TO TEN YEARS, IF NOT, GET THE PAPERS UPDATED. 

INFORM ME IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AND I WILL ASSIGN SOMEONE TO HELP.

I TRUST YOU CAN HANDLE THIS,

GRAHAM LINDEN

CEO
