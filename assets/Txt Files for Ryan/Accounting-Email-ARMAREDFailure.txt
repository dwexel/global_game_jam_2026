ISAAC READE,

I NEED YOU TO CHECK ON A GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM REPORTED BY ARMARED. PLEASE HAVE YOUR TEAM EVALUATE THE SURVEILLANCE PROTOTYPE IN THE DATA SET FILES AND VIDEO CAPTURE LABELED ARMARED SECURITY BREACH AND FIND THE ROOT CAUSE. ADJUST THE MODEL ACCORDINGLY. I HAVE HANDLED THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS MASSIVE OVERSIGHT IN THE SYSTEM’S PROCESSING, BUT I EXPECT THIS TO BE FIXED ASAP.
