QUENTIN,


THERE’S A POTENTIAL SECURITY ISSUE WITH OUR GUARDS. SENEAI WILL TELL THEM WHICH TARGETS TO PRIORITIZE, BUT THERE’S AN EXPLOIT WHERE IF SOMEONE WERE TO, SAY, CHANGE THEIR CLOTHES OR WEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT OVER THEIR FACE, THE AI HAS A HARD TIME OF RECOGNIZING THEM AS A THREAT. PLEASE ADVISE.
