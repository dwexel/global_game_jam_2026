JERRY,


DID YOU CHECK THE ACCOUNTS? WHERE DID THAT MONEY COME FROM? DID YOU MOVE A DECIMAL YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE? DID *I* MOVE A DECIMAL I SHOULDN’T HAVE? DOUBLE-CHECK. IF THIS IS RIGHT, WE TRIPLED OUR YEAR END EARNINGS BY LITERALLY FUDGING THE NUMBERS.
WHICH ISN’T LEGAL, BY THE WAY.
DOESN’T MATTER. DELETE THIS ONCE YOU READ IT, OKAY?

CFO
