IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR FILES ARE IN ORDER. THIS SEEMS TO FALL UNDER TESTING LAWS WITH CODE 00365. THERE IS NO EXISTING STATUTE ABOUT PROPRIETY OVER NEURON DATA MAPS, PERSONALITY, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DATA TAKEN IN THIS FORM. CREATING DIGITAL CLONES, ESPECIALLY WITH WAIVERS AND THROUGH YOUR TESTING METHODS SEEMS CLEAR, I DO NOT BELIEVE LIFE RIGHTS APPLY HERE. 

KEEP IT THAT WAY,
LEGAL REP KAREN LAW
